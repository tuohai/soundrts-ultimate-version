# Bring item to square & story hand-in (`has_brought_item` + `remove_item`)

Two triggers used together:

- **`has_brought_item`** (condition): player unit **carries** an item **to** a square
- **`remove_item`** (action): **remove and destroy** the item from inventory (story “hand-in”)

Typical: bring mana potion to shrine → cut scene → potion vanishes → objective complete.

Example: The Legend of Raynor ch. 18 ([18.txt](../../../res/single/The Legend of Raynor/18.txt)).

## 1. vs other item triggers

| Trigger | Detects / effect | Item location | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `has_item` | player holds item | any unit inventory | found / picked up |
| `has_brought_item` | carried item at square | units on that square | deliver by arriving (no drop) |
| `find` | object on ground | dropped on square | place item; syntax: square first `(find c3 mana_potion)` |
| `npc_has_item` | NPC received item | NPC inventory / `received_items` | give to NPC |
| `remove_item` | destroy from inventory | — | auto story hand-in |

---

## 2. Condition: `has_brought_item`

```
(has_brought_item <square> <item_type> [count])
```

- **Square**: e.g. `c3`, `"3,3"`
- **Item type**: e.g. `mana_potion`
- **Count**: optional, default `1`

True when at least one living player unit on that square holds enough of the item in inventory.

- Empty hands at square → **false**
- Item elsewhere, unit not at square → **false**
- Carried to square → **true** (no drop needed)

---

## 3. Action: `remove_item`

```
(remove_item <item_type> [square] [count])
```

- No square: remove from all living player units
- With square: only units on that square
- Count: optional, default `1`

Item is destroyed (like consuming). Pair with `cut_scene` for narrative.

## 4. Full example (ch. 18)

```
trigger player1 (has_brought_item c3 mana_potion)
    (do (cut_scene 7560) (remove_item mana_potion c3) (objective_complete 1))
```

> Chain multiple actions with `do`. Do not use `if` for three actions in a row.

Flow: pick up potion → walk to c3 shrine → condition true → cut scene → item removed → objective 1 done.

## 5. vs give-to-NPC

| Method | When |
| --- | --- |
| `npc_has_item` + player `give` | physical NPC receiver |
| `has_brought_item` + `remove_item` | arrive-and-hand-in, no NPC, auto story |
